Alright folks, it's time to continue to start flexing our C# skills and create a web application.

What better playground to start brainstorming game development projects than with a simple CRUD application?

In this repository I'm going to have three primary branches:
<ul>
    <li>main (of course)</li>
    <li>sansEF</li>
    <li>entity</li>
</ul>

The sansEF branch will be where I mainly tool around with my MVCs and explore different implementation approaches.
Think of this branch as a playground of sorts, where the most that'll happen is a scuff my knee or spin too fast.

The entity branch will be much different, I'll be persisting code to a database and implementing an SQL server.
More action is gonna take place in this branch, but they'll for the most part feel like open heart surgery until I get a true grasp of these frameworks. Awesome!

And of course, main. Main will most likely be communicating with the entity branch, as that will involve the most tooling.

If you're new to C#, .NET, Entity - make yourself at home! These technologies are incredibly powerful and will only become easier with time.

Coming from a purely JavaScript background, I cannot express how oddly liberating it is to be moving over to the C programming languages. Much less mystery = many more questions. Awesome!
